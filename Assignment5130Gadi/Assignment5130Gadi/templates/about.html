<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>This is a project in a Data-Science course in school. It is part of the Final project of the semester, which has a 30% volume of my Finals grade in computer science.
   In this project, we are instructed to find a data set that interests us, and analyze it in a Flask web project template. I have chosen a data set of a few hundred recorded NBA games, and I will analyze it in this website.
   While completing the project, I have used many technological tools to help me complete it, such as Visual Studio, W3Schools and other websites that I have found using the internet.
